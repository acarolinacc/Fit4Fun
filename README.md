Welcome to **Fit4Fun**, a conceptual mobile fitness app designed to help users stay motivated and achieve their fitness goals in an engaging and fun way. 

Our app prototype offers a range of features including:
- **Personalized Workouts**: Tailored fitness routines based on user goals.
- **Nutrition Tracking**: Simple meal logging and healthy eating tips.
- **Gamified Experience**: Level up as you reach your fitness milestones.
- **Hydration Reminders**: Never forget to drink water during your workouts.
- **Find a Gym Buddy**: Partner with users who share similar fitness goals.

This project is only the **concept and mockup phase**, focusing on wireframes and user flows that highlight the core functionality of the app.
